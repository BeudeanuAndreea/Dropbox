Task description:

The task is to build a Vue-based Dropbox
browser. This app will take your Dropbox API key and allow you to navigate to
folders and download files. 
This app would be useful if you wanted to give users access to the
contents of your Dropbox without giving out a username and password. Be
warned, however, a tech-savvy user could find your API key in the code and
abuse it, so don't publish this code to the World Wide Web.

Task requirements:

1.Loading and querying the Dropbox API

2. Listing the directories and files from your Dropbox account

3. Adding a loading state to your app

4. Creating a component for both files and folders

5. Adding links to the folder component to update the directory listing

6. Adding a download button to the file component

7. Creating a breadcrumb component, so the user can easily navigate back up
the tree

8. Dynamically updating the browser URL with vue router, so if a folder is bookmarked or a
link shared, the correct folder loads

9. Caching the current Dropbox folder contents and loading data from the
store if required

10. Pre-caching not only the folder the user is currently in but also the child
folders. This will be done by looping through the folders in the current
display and checking if they have been cached yet. If not, we can gather the
data from the API.

11. Storing the parent folder's contents, should the user have entered via a
direct URL. This will be done by utilizing the breadcrumb path to traverse
up the tree.

12. Cache the download links for the files. This currently requires an API for
every file encountered, regardless of whether the folder has been cached by
our code or not.
